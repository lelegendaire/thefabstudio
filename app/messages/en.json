    "paragraph1": "It all started with a simple thought, on a summer afternoon in 2023: what if I built a studio capable of creating truly unique websites, tailored to every person? It was just a dream, but already a strong conviction.",
    "paragraph2": "For a year, I worked on my first site – a project that would eventually allow people to easily create customizable websites. A year of testing, coding, and countless nights imagining how to make the web more original.",
    "paragraph3": "After months of work, the site was finally deployed. The Fab Studio officially came to life. I created an Instagram account to share ideas and my first creations.",
    "paragraph4": "The Fab Studio was born of a desire to push back the boundaries of the web. A visual laboratory where innovation, aesthetics and interactivity meet to invent unique experiences."
